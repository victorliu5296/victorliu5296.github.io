Abstract algebra studies the properties of mathematical structures with operators through the lens of abstraction. Although it is not at all a complex topic per se, since it often extends familiar topics, it is one with many definitions and notions to keep track of. Therefore, here is a list of some key concepts in abstract algebra.

Wikipedia has a good overview of its history on the [Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) page and a list of [Basic Concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_basic_concepts_in_abstract_algebra) on its own page.

---

### **1. Basic Set-Theoretic Structures**

#### 1.1 **Set**
   - A collection of distinct elements with no additional structure beyond membership.

#### 1.2 **Binary Operation**
   - A rule that combines two elements of a set to produce another element of the same set. For example, addition and multiplication are binary operations on numbers.

---

### **2. Algebraic Structures**

#### 2.1 **Group**
   - A set \( G \) with a binary operation satisfying:
     1. **Closure**: \( a \cdot b \in G \) for all \( a, b \in G \).
     2. **Associativity**: \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \).
     3. **Identity**: There exists \( e \in G \) such that \( e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a \) for all \( a \in G \).
     4. **Inverse**: For each \( a \in G \), there is an inverse \( a^{-1} \in G \) such that \( a \cdot a^{-1} = e \).

#### 2.2 **Abelian Group**
   - A group where the binary operation is commutative, i.e., \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \) for all \( a, b \in G \).

#### 2.3 **Ring**
   - A set \( R \) with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) where:
     1. **Addition** forms an abelian group.
     2. **Multiplication** is associative.
     3. **Distributivity**: Multiplication distributes over addition.

#### 2.4 **Field**
   - A commutative ring where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Fields allow division by nonzero elements, making them more structured than rings.

#### 2.5 **Module**
   - A generalization of vector spaces where scalars come from a ring (instead of a field). A module has a scalar multiplication that satisfies similar axioms to those of vector spaces.

#### 2.6 **Vector Space**
   - A special case of a module where scalars come from a **field**. A vector space consists of vectors that can be added and scaled by elements from the field, satisfying specific axioms.

#### 2.7 **Algebra**
   - A vector space (or module) with a bilinear multiplication operation that combines vectors to form another vector. Examples include matrix algebras and polynomial algebras.

#### 2.8 **Monoid**
   - A set \( M \) with a binary operation that is associative and has an identity element, but inverses are not required (unlike groups).

#### 2.9 **Semigroup**
   - A set \( S \) with an associative binary operation. Semigroups do not require an identity element or inverses.

---

### **3. Morphisms (Structure-Preserving Maps)**

#### 3.1 **Homomorphism**
   - A function between two algebraic structures (such as groups, rings, or vector spaces) that preserves the relevant operations. For example:
     - **Group Homomorphism**: \( \phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \) for all \( a, b \in G \).
     - **Ring Homomorphism**: \( \phi(a + b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b) \) and \( \phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \).
   
#### 3.2 **Isomorphism**
   - A **bijective** homomorphism between two algebraic structures. If \( \phi: A \to B \) is an isomorphism, the structures \( A \) and \( B \) are considered algebraically identical.

#### 3.3 **Automorphism**
   - A special case of an isomorphism where the domain and codomain are the same, i.e., \( \phi: A \to A \). It maps a structure back to itself while preserving its operations.

---

### **4. Generalizations and Specializations**

#### 4.1 **Ideal**
   - A subset of a ring \( R \) that is closed under addition and is stable under multiplication by elements of \( R \). Ideals are used to create quotient rings.

#### 4.2 **Quotient Group / Ring / Module**
   - The result of partitioning a group, ring, or module by a normal subgroup, ideal, or submodule, respectively. This quotient structure allows the construction of new algebraic structures.

#### 4.3 **Simple Group**
   - A group that has no nontrivial normal subgroups other than itself and the identity element. Simple groups are building blocks for more complex groups in group theory.

#### 4.4 **Tensor Product**
   - A construction that combines two vector spaces, modules, or algebras into a new structure. The tensor product plays a key role in multilinear algebra and other areas.

---

### **5. Non-Associative Structures**

#### 5.1 **Lie Algebra**
   - A vector space equipped with a non-associative operation called the **Lie bracket**. This structure is used to study symmetries and is widely applied in physics and geometry. It satisfies:
     1. **Bilinearity**.
     2. **Antisymmetry**: \( [a, b] = -[b, a] \).
     3. **Jacobi identity**.

---

### **6. Order-Theoretic and Categorical Structures**

#### 6.1 **Lattice**
   - A partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (join) and a greatest lower bound (meet). Lattices are used in order theory and have applications in logic and algebra.

#### 6.2 **Category**
   - A higher abstraction that consists of **objects** and **morphisms** (arrows) between those objects. Morphisms can be composed in an associative way, and categories generalize many algebraic structures by focusing on relationships between objects.
