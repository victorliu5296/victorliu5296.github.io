There's a lot of different areas of mathematics to keep up with nowadays, many of these areas interconnected, influencing and enriching one another. Here is a detailed overview of several modern and significant fields of mathematics, along with their connections and interrelations.

### 1. **Algebra**
   - **Core Ideas**: Algebra is the study of structures, relations, and operations. Modern algebra extends classical algebraic concepts into abstract settings, including:
     - **Groups, Rings, and Fields**: These are fundamental algebraic structures. Groups deal with symmetries, rings extend groups with additional operations like multiplication, and fields are rings where division is possible (except by zero).
     - **Linear Algebra**: Focuses on vector spaces and linear mappings between them. It forms the backbone of many mathematical and scientific disciplines.
       - **Multilinear Algebra**: Extends linear algebra to higher-dimensional multilinear spaces and mappings, called tensors. It is often grouped with tensor calculus.
     - **Abstract Algebra**: The generalization of classical algebraic operations and structures, dealing with more abstract systems like modules, lattices, and algebras over fields.

   - **Connections**:
     - **Number Theory**: Algebraic structures like rings and fields are fundamental in studying number properties (e.g., modular arithmetic and algebraic integers).
