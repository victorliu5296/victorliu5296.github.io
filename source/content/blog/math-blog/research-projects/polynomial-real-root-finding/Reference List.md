### 0. Implementation References
I put some references that I used for my implementation of the algorithms in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/victorliu5296/polynomial-real-root-finding).

### 1. Wikipedia
Wikipedia, although sometimes disorganized, incomplete or messy, offers a wealth of information on polynomials and root-finding algorithms.

- [Root-Finding Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm) (gives a list of general-purpose root-finding algorithms beyond polynomials)
- [Polynomial Root-Finding Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_root-finding_algorithms) (a great overview of numerical polynomial root-finding, both real and complex, and their differences)
- [Vincent's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent%27s_theorem) (contains pseudocode for bisection and continued-fractions algorithms, VAS and VCA)
- [Geometrical Properties of Polynomial Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_properties_of_polynomial_roots) (gives bounds on magnitude of roots)
