Here, I keep 2 lists for mathematical reading. One for texts I've enjoyed/am enjoying, and another for texts I plan to read.

## Good Reads

1. [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW_2024_10-01.pdf) - Sergei Treil
Absolutely fantastic book on linear algebra. Free to read online, 286 pages of clear motivation and explanations. It is an *introduction* to formal mathematics and rigorous proof writing, which makes it possible to follow along without constantly getting totally lost.
2. [AN INTRODUCTION TO STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~cox/stoch/SDE.course.pdf) - Lawrence C. Evans
I have been trying so hard to find a good introductory text on stochastic calculus, and this is the best one I've found so far. It skips out on a lot of the nitty-gritty details to focus on the main applications. It is a very readable and well-organized book so far, and includes a motivated crash course on probability theory, perfect for a beginner like me.

## Plan to Read

1. [Understanding Analysis](https://csunibo.github.io/analisi-matematica/libri/real-analysis.pdf) - Stephen Abbott
I've read about a fifth of it, it's easy to follow. I plan on finishing it.
