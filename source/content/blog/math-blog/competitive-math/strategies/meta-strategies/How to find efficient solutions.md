**Mastering Efficient Problem Solving in Competitive Math**  
*A Guide to Strategic Thinking, Case Reduction, and Symmetry Exploitation*  

---

### **1. Diagnose the Problem Type**  
**Cues:** Keywords like "how many," "maximize," or "prove for all \(n\)."  
**Goal:** Identify the domain (algebra, combinatorics, etc.) and complexity.  
**Example:**  
- *"Find all integer solutions"* → Number theory (modular arithmetic, Bézout’s identity).  
- *"How many ways..."* → Combinatorics (permutations, inclusion-exclusion).  

---

### **2. Exploit Symmetry**  
**Cues:** Interchangeable variables (e.g., \(x, y, z\)), homogeneous equations.  
**Strategies:**  
- **Assume equality first:** Test \(x = y\) in symmetric equations.  
- **Group identical cases:** For repeated objects, use multinomial coefficients instead of enumerating permutations.  

**Example:**  
- *Problem:* Solve \(x + y + z = 6\), \(xy + yz + zx = 11\).  
  - Assume \(x = y\): \(2x + z = 6\) and \(x^2 + 2xz = 11\). Solve for \(x\), then \(z\).  

---

### **3. Leverage Bounds and Constraints**  
**Cues:** Inequalities, divisibility conditions, or fixed totals (e.g., \(a + b + c = 1\)).  
**Strategies:**  
- **Bound variables:** Restrict values using constraints (e.g., \(x > 0\) → \(x \geq 1\)).  
- **Optimize with AM-GM:** For problems like "maximize \(xy\) given \(x + y = 12\)," use \(xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2\).  

**Example:**  
- *Problem:* "Find all positive integers \(x, y\) with \(x + y = 10\)."  
  - Bounds: \(1 \leq x \leq 9\), \(y = 10 - x\). Only 9 cases needed.  

---

### **4. Use Mathematical Identities and Theorems**  
**Cues:** Repeated terms, known theorem keywords (e.g., "collinear," "cyclic quadrilateral").  
**Strategies:**  
- **Factor or expand:** Rewrite expressions using identities (e.g., \(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\)).  
- **Apply theorems:** Ceva’s Theorem (collinearity), Chinese Remainder Theorem (modular systems).  

**Example:**  
- *Problem:* Solve \(17x \equiv 5 \mod 23\).  
  - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \(x \equiv 17^{-1} \cdot 5 \mod 23\).  

---

### **5. Avoid Brute Force with Patterns**  
**Cues:** Large numbers, recursive definitions, or "prove existence."  
**Strategies:**  
- **Modular cycles:** For \(7^{123} \mod 10\), note \(7^1=7\), \(7^2=9\), \(7^3=3\), \(7^4=1\) (cycle of 4).  
- **Pigeonhole Principle:** Prove existence without enumeration (e.g., 367 people → 2 share a birthday).  

**Example:**  
- *Problem:* "Prove in any 5-card hand, two cards share a suit."  
  - 5 cards (pigeons) and 4 suits (holes) → At least two in one suit.  

---

### **6. Divide and Conquer**  
**Cues:** Recursive structures, multiple variables, or "for all \(n\)."  
**Strategies:**  
- **Case analysis:** Split by parity (even/odd) or residue classes.  
- **Iterative computation:** Precompute small cases for sequences (e.g., Fibonacci).  

**Example:**  
- *Problem:* "Prove \(n^2 - n\) is even for all integers \(n\)."  
  - Split into cases: If \(n\) is even, \(n^2\) and \(n\) are even. If \(n\) is odd, \(n^2\) and \(n\) are odd.  

---

### **7. Verify and Refine**  
**Cues:** "Find all solutions," edge cases, or bounds.  
**Strategies:**  
- **Back-substitute:** Plug answers into original equations.  
- **Test extremes:** Check \(n = 0\), \(x = 1\), or degenerate shapes.  

**Example:**  
- *Problem:* Solve \(\sqrt{x + 3} = x - 1\).  
  - Squaring gives \(x + 3 = x^2 - 2x + 1\) → \(x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0\). Check solutions \(x = 2\) (valid) and \(x = -1\) (invalid).  

---

### **Quick-Reference Summary**  
1. **Diagnose the Problem:** Identify domain and keywords.  
2. **Exploit Symmetry:** Assume equality, group identical cases.  
3. **Use Bounds:** Restrict variables with constraints.  
4. **Apply Theorems/Identities:** Factor, expand, or invoke theorems.  
5. **Avoid Brute Force:** Modular cycles, Pigeonhole Principle.  
6. **Divide and Conquer:** Split into cases or precompute.  
7. **Verify:** Back-substitute and test edge cases.
