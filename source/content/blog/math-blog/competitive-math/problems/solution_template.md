**Template for Problem Solutions** *(With Guiding Questions)*  

1. **Problem Statement**  
   *Q: What exactly is being asked?*  
   - Clearly restate the problem.  
   *Example:* "Prove √2 cannot be written as a fraction of two integers."  

2. **Initial Intuition**  
   *Q: What’s your first instinct or assumption?*  
   - Describe patterns, guesses, or starting assumptions.  
   *Example:* "Assume √2 is rational. If this leads to a contradiction, it must be irrational."  

3. **Step-by-Step Solution**  
   *Q: How can you break this down logically?*  
   - Write the solution flow.  
   *Example:*  
   - Let √2 = a/b (simplified fraction).  
   - Square: 2b² = a² ⇒ a is even.  
   - Substitute a = 2k ⇒ b² = 2k² ⇒ b is even. Contradiction. 
   Note that this step is quite involved, so there will be another post on this.

4. **Key Insights**  
   *Q: What made the solution work?*  
   - Highlight pivotal ideas or techniques.  
   *Example:*  
   - Proof by contradiction.  
   - Divisibility/parity arguments.  

5. **Fragile Assumptions**  
   *Q: What could break this solution?*  
   - Identify implicit assumptions or overlooked edge cases.  
   *Example:*  
   - Not ensuring a/b is in lowest terms.  
   - Missing the parity chain (a even ⇒ b even).  

6. **Alternative Paths**  
   *Q: Could a different method work?*  
   - Suggest other approaches.  
   *Example:*  
   - Geometric infinite descent (e.g., shrinking right triangles).  

7. **Generalizations**  
   *Q: Can this apply to similar problems?*  
   - Extend the core idea to broader cases.  
   *Example:*  
   - Replace 2 with any prime *p* to prove √p is irrational.  

8. **Connections**  
   *Q: Where else have you seen this pattern?*  
   - Link to analogous problems or domains.  
   *Example:*  
   - Similar contradiction logic applies to proving log₂3 is irrational.  

9. **Reflection**  
   *Q: What would you do differently next time?*  
   - Critique your process and identify improvements.  
   *Example:*  
   - "Next time, I’d check if the Rational Root Theorem could shortcut the proof."

**Example Flow with Questions (√2 Proof):**  
- **Key Insights**: *Q: What unlocked the solution?*  
  - Contradiction + parity analysis.  
- **Fragile Assumptions**: *Q: What nearly broke the proof?*  
  - Forgetting to reduce a/b initially.  
- **Connections**: *Q: Similar problems?*  
  - Irrationality of √3, e, or sums like √2 + √3.  
- **Reflection**: *Q: What’s your takeaway?*  
  - "Contradiction is powerful for impossibility proofs—look for structural mismatches."  

---  
**Why This Works**: Questions force active engagement, surface hidden assumptions, and link ideas across domains. The template becomes a *dialogue* with your reasoning.
