How many ways can the board look after the game is over?

There is a polynomial\[q(x) = c_3x^3+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0\]such that $D(m) = q(m)$ for all odd integers $m\ge 5$. What is $c_1?$

$\textbf{(A)}\ {-}6\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ {-}1\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 11$

#### Solution
The first thing we notice that we are given 4 variable numbers, but the answer is a cubic polynomial, hinting that there are actually only 3 degrees of freedom. What explains this?

Let's identify the constraints:
1. $m \ge 5$ is an odd integer.
   - Equivalently, $m = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \ge 2$.
2. Each $a_i$ is a distinct integer in $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$.
3. $m | (a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4) \iff a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4 \equiv 0 \pmod m$

Aha! Fixing 3 variables determines the last one uniquely since there is only one integer from $1$ to $m$ that will satisfy the condition:

$$a_1 \equiv -(a_2+a_3+a_4) \pmod m$$

This is because the set $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$ forms a complete residue system mod $m$.

Since the $a_i$ are all distinct, determining our $a_i$ is equivalent to selecting permutations from the set $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$. The last one is determined by the first 3, so we pick 3 numbers. The number of possibilities is given by:

$$_m P _3 = m(m-1)(m-2).$$

But wait! The last number could collide with the first 3 and break the distinctness.

Let our numbers picked be $a,b,c$ in any order, and let $d$ be the last number. We require $d \notin \{a,b,c\}$. To calculate this, we can use a complementary approach: consider if $d$ clashes with one of the first 3.

Notice the symmetry in the permutations: the cases $d=a$, $d=b$, $d=c$ are equivalent in probability. WLOG, let $d = a$. We will multiply the probability by 3 at the end. which are disjoint equivalent cases. Then the condition for failure is:

$$a+b+c+a \equiv 0 \pmod m$$

$$2a+b+c \equiv 0 \pmod m$$

What is the probability that $2a+b+c$ is divisible by $m$? It seems hard to find. But we have yet to use our remaining condition: 1) $m$ is an odd integer $\ge 5$.

This is the key step that is the hardest to find: imagine picking a quadruple $(a,a,b,c)$, each number represented on a circle of integers $1$ to $m$, then skewering all these circles onto one axis.

Then, imagine rotating this skewer on its axis. There are $m$ possible rotations, and each rotation is a valid quadruple. The trick is to realize that out of the $m$ possible rotations, exactly $1$ is valid, i.e. $2a+b+c \equiv 0 \pmod m$. This is because, if you imagine the sum rotating around the clock of $0$ to $m-1$ by $4$ at a time for each rotation of the skewer, then we will cover all numbers $\{0,1,\dots,m-1\}$ exactly once.

Formally, you can justify this by defining a bijection as follows: for a given quadruple $a,a,b,c$, we can define a rotation as the mapping

$$R: (a,a,b,c) \mapsto (a+1,a+1,b+1,c+1)$$

Let $x=(a,a,b,c)$, $s(x)=2a+b+c$. Notice that $s(R(x))=2(a+1)+(b+1)+(c+1)=s(x)+4$. In general, for the $n-th$ rotation, the sum becomes $s(x)+4n$. Remember, we want $s(x)+4n \equiv 0 \pmod m$.

The second critical step is to notice that $4$ and $m$ must be coprime, since $m$ is odd. This implies that $4$ is invertible modulo $m$.

But finally, this means that $s(x)+4n \equiv 0 \pmod m$ for exactly one rotation configuration $n \in \{0,1,\dots,m-1\}$, as it is uniquely determined by $$n \equiv -4^{-1} s(x) \pmod m.$$

Hence, the probability that $2a+b+c$ is divisible by $m$ is exactly $\frac{1}{m}$. The probability of distinctness for $d$ from $a,b,c$ is $1 - 3 \cdot \frac{1}{m} = \frac{m-3}{m}$.

Our final polynomial becomes:

$$D(m) =m(m-1)(m-2) \cdot \frac{m-3}{m} = (m-1)(m-2)(m-3)$$

The linear coefficient is $(-1)(-2)+(-1)(-3)+(-2)(-3) = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}$. 

##### Alternative Paths



##### Key Insights

1. While there are 4 variable numbers, the answer is a cubic polynomial, hinting that we are constrainted to only 3 degrees of freedom.
2. Noticing the rotational symmetry, we can create equivalence classes with one valid quadruple in each class to calculate the number of valid cases.

##### Fragile Assumptions

1. Here, $m$ must be an odd integer. The $\ge 5$ condition is simply to ensure we can select a quadriple. In fact, we can prove that $D(m) \ne q(m)$ for any even integer $m \ge 4$.

##### Non-Fragile Assumptions
1. The $a_i$ are distinct integers in $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$. The same solution works if we allow duplicates, but the problem in fact becomes much easier since there is much more structured symmetry so the equivalence classes are trivial to form, directly giving $D(m)=\frac{m^4}{m}=m^3$ for all $m$, odd or even.

##### Alternative Paths

1. Direct Attack

If you are familiar enough with this type of problem, you might immediately recognize the approach of equivalence classes. [MRENTHUSIASM's solution](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_Fall_AMC_12A_Problems/Problem_25#:~:text=.%20What%20is-,Solution%201%20(Complete%20Residue%20System),-%5Bedit%5D) on AoPS is an example of this: he directly forms equivalence classes from all quadruples, finding $D(m)=\frac{1}{m}m(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)$ for odd $m$ since $\gcd(m,4)=1$.

2. Complementary Counting

Instead of using probability and symmetry arguments, we can directly use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of quadruples is $m(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)$, and we want to find the number of valid quadruples.

A valid quadruple is one that satisfies $d \equiv -(a+b+c) \pmod m$, so let our events be $A := (d = a)$ which are all equal in size. We have 3 such copies for $d=a$, $d=b$, $d=c$. Since $d=a$, we have:

$$-2a \equiv b+c \pmod m$$

As before, we can use a rotation argument to see the equivalence of cases, so consider the case $a=0$. We have $(1+m-1),(2+m-2),\dots,(m-1+1)$, so $m-1$ cases. In general, the case where $b\equiv c \equiv -a \pmod m$ is excluded.

Now, consider which $a$ values are valid. We have from $1$ to $m$ such values, but it must be different from $b$ and $c$. Hence, there are $m-2$ valid $a$ values.

The bad cases are hence $3(m-1)(m-2)$ cases. Hence, the total number of cases is $m(m-1)(m-2)-3(m-1)(m-2)=(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)$.

3. Sum of First Perfect Squares

Unfinished idea: let $m=2n+1$, biject $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$ to $\{-n,\dots,n\}$ (still a complete residue system). WLOG let $a<b\le 0\le c<d$ (multiply by 4!). Cases: $c=0$ or $c>0$ (similarly for $b$ by symmetry). Counting cases for $c>0$ including cases with potential clashes between $a,b,c,d$, we get $2[1^2+2^2+\dots+(n-1)^2]$. By symmetry in $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ we divide by 2. Also, the number of cases where $a,b,c,d$ clash with $c>0$ is equivalent to the number of cases where $c=0$. Hence the answer is $4![1^2+2^2+\dots+(n-1)^2]=(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)$.

4. Generating Function

We can bash with generating functions.

We count ordered quadruples \((a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)\) of distinct integers from \(\{1,2,\dots,m\}\) whose sum is divisible by \(m\) using generating functions and a roots-of-unity filter.

### Step 1: Generating Function
Define the bivariate generating function:
\[
F(z,x) = \prod_{a=1}^{m} (1+z\,x^a),
\]
where \(z\) marks chosen elements and \(x\) records their sum. The coefficient \([z^4]F(z,x)\) counts 4-element subsets of \(\{1,2,\dots,m\}\) with sum \(k\).

The generating function for ordered quadruples is:
\[
G(x) = 24 \cdot [z^4]F(z,x).
\]

### Step 2: Extracting Multiples of \(m\)
To count sums divisible by \(m\), we apply a roots-of-unity filter:
\[
D(m) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} G(\omega^j),
\]
where \(\omega\) is a primitive \(m\)th root of unity.

- For \(j=0\), \(F(z,1) = (1+z)^m\), so \([z^4]F(z,1) = \binom{m}{4}\).
- For \(j\neq 0\), \(\prod_{a=1}^{m} (1+z\omega^{ja}) = 1+z^m\), contributing zero to \([z^4]\).

Thus, 
\[
D(m) = \frac{24}{m} \binom{m}{4} = (m-1)(m-2)(m-3).
\]

### Step 3: Extracting Coefficients
Expanding,
\[
D(m) = m^3 - 6m^2 + 11m - 6.
\]
Matching with \(q(m) = c_3m^3 + c_2m^2 + c_1m + c_0\), we find \(c_1 = 11\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]

5. Interpolation Bash

Since a cubic polynomial has $4$ coefficients, it suffices to compute $D(m)$ for $4$ values of $m$ and it will interpolate the polynomial by solving a linear system. This is shown in [Steven Chen's solution](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_Fall_AMC_12A_Problems/Problem_25#:~:text=~MRENTHUSIASM-,Solution%202%20(Symmetric%20Congruent%20Numbers%20and%20Interpolation),-%5Bedit%5D).

If you are familiar with discrete calculus, you can fit the polynomial directly using 4 consecutive points of odd $m$.

To determine the coefficient \( c_1 \) of the cubic polynomial \( q(m) = c_3m^3 + c_2m^2 + c_1m + c_0 \) such that \( D(m) = q(m) \) for all odd integers \( m \ge 5 \), we use finite differences on the given values of \( D(m) \).

Given values:
- \( D(5) = 4!\cdot 1 = 24 \)
- \( D(7) = 4!\cdot 5 = 120 \)
- \( D(9) = 4!\cdot 14 = 336 \)
- \( D(11) = 4!\cdot 30 = 720 \)

If you are astute, you might recognize the sum of the first natural squares pattern:
- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 1^2 + 2^2 = 5 \)
- \( 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14 \)
- \( 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 30 \)

In this case, let \( n = \frac{m - 3}{2} \). Then \( D(m) = 4! \cdot \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \). Substituting \( n = \frac{m - 3}{2} \):
\[
D(m) = 4 \cdot \frac{(m - 3)}{2} \cdot \frac{(m - 1)}{2} \cdot (m - 2) = (m - 3)(m - 1)(m - 2).
\]
Expanding gives \( c_1 = 11\).

If you unable to see this, then we proceed as usual with bashing. First, compute the finite differences with step size 2:
- First differences: \( 96, 216, 384 \)
- Second differences: \( 120, 168 \)
- Third difference: \( 48 \)

For a cubic polynomial, the third finite difference is constant and equal to \( 48 \). This gives \( 48 = 6c_3 \cdot 2^3 \), leading to \( c_3 = 1 \).

Next, use the second finite differences to find \( c_2 \). The second difference at \( m = 5 \) is 120:
- The second difference polynomial is \( 24c_3m + 48c_3 + 8c_2 \)
- Substituting \( c_3 = 1 \) and solving gives \( 120 = 24 \cdot 5 + 48 + 8c_2 \), leading to \( c_2 = -6 \).

Finally, use the first finite differences to find \( c_1 \). The first difference at \( m = 5 \) is 96:
- The first difference polynomial is \( 6c_3m^2 + (12c_3 + 4c_2)m + (8c_3 + 4c_2 + 2c_1) \)
- Substituting \( c_3 = 1 \) and \( c_2 = -6 \), and solving gives \( 96 = 6 \cdot 25 - 12 \cdot 5 - 16 + 2c_1 \), leading to \( c_1 = 11 \).

Thus, the coefficient \( c_1 \) is \(\boxed{11}\).

##### Generalizations And Connections

The linear coefficient is a Stirling number of the first kind, specifically $s(3+1,3-1)=s(4,2)$. We know that for symmetric polynomials, $e_1^2=e_2+2c_1$, such that $c_1=\frac{e_1^2-e_2}{2}$.

We have $e_1=1+2+3=\binom{4}{2}=6$, while $e_2=1^2+2^2+3^2=6\cdot \frac{2\cdot 3+1}{3}=14$. So the final answer is

$$\frac{6^2 - 14}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }11}.$$
