# Portfolio

## Projects
Most of my projects' source code can be found my GitHub account: `victorliu5296`.

### Custom physics simulator
High school physics classes all assume that acceleration is always constant. What if you could manipulate every single position derivative of a projectile? Find out in this browser application made using three.js and TypeScript:

### Polynomial real root finder
I have implemented a solver to find real roots of real polynomials based on bisection in TypeScript/HTML. You can try it out here:

### Lottery ticket hypothesis experiments
I conducted experiments to verify the results of the paper "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks". A simple neural network gets iteratively pruned and tested on its classification abilities in the MNIST dataset. It consists of a Jupyter notebook with Python code that you can directly run in Google Colab.

### Formalization of the Newton-Kantorovich theorem in Lean 4
I formalized a version of the Newton-Kantorovich theorem with 1 constant in Lean 4, a functional programming formal language for proof verification according to the proof of the paper [ON THE NEWTON-KANTOROVICH THEOREM](https://www.ljll.fr/~mardare/recherche/pdf/NK_AA.pdf).

### Reinforcement learning projects
Very basic RL projects using a simple setup with Gymnasium (a maintained version of OpenAI Gym) in Python.

### Timer Project
Check out my timer project [here](https://victorliu5296.github.io/html-timer). It's a simple timer built with HTML and JavaScript.
